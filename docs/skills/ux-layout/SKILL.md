# UX Layout

Design the user experience as an independent concern. The domain model describes what exists; the UX describes how the user interacts with it. These are not the same thing, and mapping them 1:1 is a common mistake.

## Why UX is independent from the domain

A domain model with 5 entities does NOT mean 5 screens. The user's mental model of the application is different from the data model:
- Multiple entities might appear on one screen
- One entity might span multiple screens
- Navigation follows user tasks, not entity relationships
- The best UX often hides domain complexity from the user

**Trap to avoid:** "We have a Point entity, so we need a Point screen." No - you need screens for what the user wants to *do*, not for what the data looks like.

## Process

### Step 1: User goals

Ask the user:
- Who uses this application?
- What are the 3-5 main things they want to accomplish?
- What's the most common task? (This should be the easiest to do)
- What's the most important task? (This should be the most prominent)

### Step 2: User journeys

For each main goal, map the journey:
1. Where does the user start?
2. What steps do they take?
3. What information do they need at each step?
4. Where do they end up?

Keep journeys short. If a common task takes more than 3 steps, question whether it can be simpler.

### Step 3: Screen inventory

Based on the journeys, identify the screens:
- What screens are needed?
- What does each screen show?
- What actions are available on each screen?
- How does the user move between screens?

Draw a simple navigation map: boxes for screens, arrows for navigation paths.

### Step 4: Challenge the UX

- Can any two screens be combined?
- Is the most common task reachable in one click from the start?
- Are there dead ends where the user gets stuck?
- Does the navigation feel natural, or does it follow the data model?
- Would a first-time user know what to do?

### Step 5: Validate against domain

Check that the UX covers the domain:
- Can the user access all domain entities they need?
- Are CRUD operations available where needed?
- Does the UX support the relationships in the domain model?

But do NOT let the domain dictate the UX structure.

## Exit criteria

- [ ] User goals are identified (3-5 main goals)
- [ ] User journeys are mapped for each goal
- [ ] Screen inventory exists with navigation map
- [ ] Most common task is reachable in minimal steps
- [ ] UX is not a 1:1 mirror of the domain model
- [ ] User confirms the experience matches how they'd want to use the app
